If you want to view the visualization. After cloning the repo and installing everything, run 

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 &

in the raft-haskell directory.

If for some reason that port is unavailable on your machine, you may change port, but you need to change the urls in the viz.html in the files folder to redirect to the right port. This code is line 102 of the javascript.

var url = "http://localhost:8000/tmp/" + name + ".csv";

Change that port to whichever you need it to. The visualization has only been tested in Firefox, so please use that.

This is the URL to type into Firefox

http://localhost:8000/viz/viz.html
